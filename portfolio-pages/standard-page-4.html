			<p>Respond Point of Care™ was developed by InductiveHealth to enable point-of-care laboratory testing data collection and reporting by non-traditional facilities such as nursing homes, schools, workplaces, and more conducting COVID-19 tests.
                It’s a web-based application that provides a secured user interface for facility enrollment and user management and a simple workflow for patient demographic, HHS AOE, and test result data capture. It can be used on a variety of devices, from mobile phones and tablets, to desktops. The user interface is simple and streamlined, enabling non-technical testing facility personnel to capture key data fields required for public health reporting. Once test records are ready, we deliver them right to the public health jurisdiction where the facility is located.
