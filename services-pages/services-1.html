  <div class="desc">We are the leader in <span class="color-text"><strong>hosting, support, and management of the NEDSS Base System (NBS)</strong></span> for State and Jursidictional health departments, currently managing eleven (11) implementations of the NBS.  Using our advanced multi-factor authentication, secure private
	cloud hosting environment, deep domain knowledge, and sophisticated HL7 integration, all you need to bring is your users to start receiving actionable public health data in as little as 30 days, typically for far lower costs than hosting in-house.<br />
    <br />
    We also provide other public health technology in a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, including StarLIMS, ArboNET, and our own NDR Platform, bringing the same expertise in the technology and best-practice business processes that we do for our hosted NBS offering.  
	<br/><br/>Talk to us about our <span class="color-text"><strong>Health Department In a Box<span>&#8480;</span></strong></span> offering, which includes a pre-integrated suite of all of the core systems needed to capture, analyze, and manage the public health data of a population, from vital records, to communicable disease surveillance, STD/HIV, cancer, and chronic disease surveillance, immunization registry, lab information systems, and even syndromic surveillance.</div>
