  <p>With advanced molecular and genomic laboratory testing, more and more analysis is conducted in software, using increasingly large requirements for computational resources, data storage, and new skillsets.  Many labs have difficulty sourcing these required computational and skills resources to support these new lab methods. </p>
    <p>The <span class="color-text"><strong>InductiveHealth Genomic Platform&#8480;</strong></span> delivers an integrated computational environment that avoids the time, complexity, hassle, and cost of trying to 
	stand up your own environment and toolset to analyze and store advanced molecular and genomic data.</p></div>
