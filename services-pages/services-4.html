  <p>InductiveHealth manages many production public health information systems according to a variety of stringent State and Federal requirements.  These include managing the first successful FISMA Certification and Accreditation approval under the Centers for Disease Control’s revised Security Accreditation and Authorization (SA&A), authorized under FISMA.  All of our information system controls are based on NIST 800-53 revision 4 controls, which form the foundation of the Federal Government’s required information systems controls and processes.  We manage to FISMA-Moderate compliant controls, which corresponds to the typical information system security classification for information systems containing protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII).
