  <div class="desc"><p>We are experts in Electronic Disease Surveillance Systems (EDSS), including EpiTrax, the NEDSS Base System, and ESSENCE for Syndromic Surveillance, with more successful implementations of EDSS than any other firm. <p>We understand what epidemiologists need because many of us are epidemiologists, too. We have built our practices and processes around optimizing EDSS to get public health agencies the data they need, when they need it.</p> 
  </p>
  <p>We are the sole license holder of the ESSENCE platform for Syndromic Surveillance and maintain a close partnership with its developers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). Through this partnership, we support ESSENCE through software-as-a-service hosting for more than 25 jurisdictions at the local, state, territorial, and national levels.
  </p>
  <p>We design and build our own surveillance system technologies as well. Our Respondâ„¢ Contact Tracing and Symptom Monitoring application is web-based, easy-to-use, and scalable to meet demands to support public health action at the local to global levels. Our National Data Repository Platform(SM) is an advanced, individual-level disease surveillance system designed for national-level communicable disease surveillance and analysis, handling complex diseases such as HIV to meet PEPFAR objectives and enabling analysis throughout the continuum of care.
